# Spacepunk
Spacepunk is a Minecraft space exploration mod. This mod is being developed for Fabric and a Forge port is not coming anytime soon, if at all. Compatability with other space exploration mods currently isn't being considered.

### Goals
#### Minimalism
There are a lot of people that enjoy working their way through a complicated tech-tree, assembling their rocket piece by piece, and holding space to slow down. But not everyone is like that, some people just want to build a cool base on an alien world. 
#### Fantasy
In 1800s to early 1900s, it was believed that there were Carboniferous jungles and swamps below the venusian clouds. This is way cooler than the truth and is therefore what my version of venus will be based on. In fact, I'll probably not even include most of the planets in the real solar system because faithful adaptations of them wouldn't be interesting places to go. (pretty much every planet will have some form of life)
#### Integration
I intend this mod to work well when it is the only mod installed. By that I mean, it will use vanilla blocks, items and resources where possible. An example of this is rockets being fueled by lava as opposed to oil.

### Roadmap
These are just some ideas for features, put in a rough order:
1. Moon 
2. Different Gravity
3. No atmosphere
4. Venus - Jungles and Swamps
5. Mars - Desert-like, with villages and canals
6. Satellite/orbit
7. Europa - An ice layer with a thriving underwater ecosystem.
8. Vulkan - An extremely firey planet, when you are out in the sun you get a heat-stroke status effect that does a numebr of bad things.
9. Viridis - Extremely tall trees, low-gravity, breathable atmosphere, moss everywhere
